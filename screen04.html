    A series of patterns made with the Maurer Rose equations. As I'm looping through the constants in the equations, the patterns will go on forever and continue to be new, although sometimes they seem to repeat. I named it Cryptic after a group in one of my favorite book series, The Stormlight Archive, who constantly shift in infinite patterns (it's a fantasy book haha). Also, I feel like it just looks a bit cryptic because you can't really understand the patterns.
    Reset using the R key on your keyboard. Pause the piece at any time using the S key on your keyboard.
